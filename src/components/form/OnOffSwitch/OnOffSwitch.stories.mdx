# OnOffSwitch

The `<OnOffSwitch />` should be used when you have an option flag that does something important and
perhaps is not part of a regular form, where you probably would use a `<Checkbox />` instead.

<ArgsTable of={OnOffSwitch} />

                <OnOffSwitch value={active} onChange={setActive}>
                    Turn me on or off
