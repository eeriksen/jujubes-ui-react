# Axios

In order to provide common services for file upload we have included axios as the preferred ajax library.
An instance of axios is immediatly created. All you have to do is set `baseUrl` and preferred headers.

### Setup

Define your base URL.

<Canvas>
    <Story name="baseURL">
        <Code>axios.defaults.baseURL = "http://localhost:8080";</Code>
    </Story>
</Canvas>
