# Clickable

This component should be used as a wrapper whenever you are creating a custom clickable component.
This way we can bind events to all "clickable" components in one place, if say we would like to
add haptic feedback (vibration) on all click events on mobile.

<ArgsTable of={Clickable} />

### Basic
<Canvas>
    <Story name="basic" >
        <Clickable>
            Clickable element
        </Clickable>
    </Story>
</Canvas>
