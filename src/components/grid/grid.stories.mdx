# Grid

This grid is used when you want to utilize the size of a desktop sized screen, but needs to break
that same content on mobile devices. The grid is a flexible 24-unit system where you can define sizes and offsets
of content blocks that can break into separate rows on three different breakpoints, small (sm), medium (md) and large (lg).

## Rows
<Preview>
  <Story name="color">
    <Row>
        <Col span={24} />
    </Row>
  </Story>
</Preview>
